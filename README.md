📋 QA Portfolio: Medical Precision & Usability Audits

By Courtney | Medical QA Specialist Specializing in Privacy (PII), Accessibility, and Logic-Flow Auditing.

🌟 Professional Summary

Transitioning from a background in high-stakes medical office environments, I bring a unique "Clinical Eye" to software quality assurance. My testing philosophy, known as The Authentic Imperfectionist, focuses on identifying where software fails real human users through logic gaps, privacy risks, and inconsistent documentation.

🔬 Featured Bug Reports (UserTesting Platform Audit)

The following reports were identified during a "Black Box" exploratory session of the UserTesting registration flow.

1. ⚖️ Compliance & Logic Inconsistency: Age Rating
Severity: Medium | Priority: High
• Defect: A mismatch exists between the Apple App Store rating (4+) and the internal legal Terms of Service (18+).
• Impact: Allows ineligible minors to download software they are legally barred from using, creating potential compliance risks and user frustration.
• Status: Reported for Version Alignment.

3. 🔐 UI/UX Data Constraint: Privacy Selection Conflict
Severity: Low | Priority: Medium
• Defect: The "Privacy Check" task uses Radio Buttons for multi-factor sensitive data categories (Financial Info & Home Address), forcing an artificial single-choice constraint.
• Impact: Results in incomplete data collection regarding PII (Personally Identifiable Information) concerns.
• Recommendation: Replace Radio Buttons with Checkboxes to allow for multi-select validation.

🛠️ Testing Toolbox
• Hardware: MacBook Air M3, iPhone 16, iPad.
